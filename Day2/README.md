# workshop Machine Learning in Python

## Dependencies

+ Anaconda (include : numpy,matplotlib,pandas, sklearn)
+ jupyter

---------
## Objective:

The repository is a learning exercise to:

 - Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
   

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

1.  Identifying the problem and load data Sources
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
3.  Pre-Processing the Data
4.  Build model
5.  Improving the best models.

-------------
The workshop is divided into three sections :

 Introduction Machine Learning (*.ppt) (5-10 minutes)
 Study case 1 : Classification problem (20 -25 minutes)
 Study case 2 : Regression problem (20 -25 minutes)
 Study case 3 :
